# Discord-Bot
This is a Discord bot using the programming language Python and discord.py, a "modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord". Discord is a voice, video and text communication service.
Here are the features I want to impliment
- Automatically respond to various chat commands with a forward slash (i.e. /help, which displays the full list of commands that the bot is able to respond to.
- A music player that streams music off YouTube.
